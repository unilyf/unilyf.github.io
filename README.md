# Connect and LearnTogether
Once complete, this website will allow Monash Students to see who's in their class, contact class members and also compare timetable with friends. Additionally it will allow students to make notes together as a class, share notes with class members or just organise and backup notes on Google Drive. 

If you answer yes to any of these, it will be for you:
* Are my friends with me in any of the classes I'm enrolled in?
* When can I catch up with my friends at uni?
* Just curious to know who's in your class in advance?
* Wish I could make notes together with my peers in classes?
* Organise and backup notes on Google Drive?
* Share and review notes with others studying the same unit?
* Want to try out something awesome?


<i>Coming soon, currently being made with love.</i>
